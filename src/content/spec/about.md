# About Me

Welcome to my lair! I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast and penetration tester who loves poking at digital fortresses until they spill their secrets. If you're into exploring the dark alleys of the web and uncovering hidden treasures, you’re in the right place.

## Who Am I?

You can call me **cyb3ritic**—the digital detective who’s always on the lookout for that elusive 0day. I was bitten by the cybersecurity bug back in May 2023 when I infiltrated the ranks of bi0sblr’s CTF team, specializing in Web Exploitation. Ever since, I’ve been on a mission to turn every 404 into a jackpot.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I share my adventures, war stories, and the occasional brain-melting puzzle from the world of pentesting. Buckle up for some byte-sized fun:

### HackTheBox Writeups

HackTheBox is my playground, where virtual machines fall victim to my digital sleuthing. Each writeup will walk you through the heist:

- **Enumeration**: The art of shaking the tree until some useful info falls out.
- **Exploitation**: How I bypassed defenses and made machines sing like canaries.
- **Post Exploitation**: What I did once inside—think privilege escalations, cleanup jobs, and covering tracks like a pro.
- **Lessons Learned**: The wisdom gained after each hackathon, because even hackers need to RTFM.

### Pentesting Tutorials

Whether you're a script kiddie or a seasoned black hat, my tutorials will help you level up. Expect tips, tricks, and tool guides that will make you say, “I can’t believe it was that easy!”

### Personal Projects

Sometimes, I dabble in side quests like developing new tools or researching emerging threats. When I’m not busy cracking systems, I’m building stuff that (hopefully) others won’t crack.

## Why I Blog

This blog is my way of giving back to the hackerverse that’s taught me so much. By documenting my exploits and sharing the tricks of the trade, I aim to help others sharpen their claws and stay ahead of the game.

## Get in Touch

I’m always down for a chat with fellow hackers, so hit me up if you’ve got questions, want to brainstorm, or just feel like swapping war stories.
